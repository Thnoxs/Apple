#  AetherFlow M5 — Kinetic Energy Visualizer

A cinematic, high-performance web experience featuring the **Apple M5 chip** interacting with an organic circuit environment. Built with a focus on fluid motion, hardware-accelerated SVG animations, and premium industrial design aesthetics.



## ⚡ The Vision
The goal was to move away from static, "grid-based" tech backgrounds and create something that feels **alive**. `AetherFlow` simulates the intake of raw data/energy from terminal nodes, funneling them into the M5 core through organic, curved traces.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5 / CSS3**: Custom keyframe animations and filter effects.
- **SVG Graphics**: Quadratic Bezier curves for smooth, non-linear circuit paths.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Real-time 3D perspective handling (Tilt-on-hover).
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Optimized via `will-change` properties for 60FPS performance.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Inward Kinetic Flow**: Energy pulses travel from outer terminal nodes into the chip core.
* **Power Breathing**: The M5 chip dynamically scales and glows in sync with incoming data pulses.
* **Metallic Shine Sweep**: A diagonal light ray periodically sweeps across the chip's surface.
* **Organic Pathing**: Circuit lines use `Quadratic Bezier` curves instead of rigid 90° angles.
* **Responsive 3D Tilt**: Interactive depth effect that reacts to user cursor movement.

## 🚀 Quick Start
Just clone the repo and open `index.html`. No dependencies, no bloat.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thnoxs/Apple.git
